# LPG GAS LEAKAGE DETECTION

This project presents a gas leak detection system designed to detect methane gas using an MQ-5 gas sensor and Node MCU board for processing.The system continuously monitors gas concentrations, triggering a notification when the concentration exceeds a predefined threshold. The notification is sent via the Pushbullet API service, providing real-time alerts to users on their mobile devices or computers. A Servo is used to represent the movement of the gas valve when triggered during leak detection. Hence forming a LPG gas leakage detection system.
